ICOORDSTRANS
------------

This code is highly unmaintained and is kept for historical reasons.
Most operations provided by this library are covered by the free
software "Proj4". However it can be still useful for some transforms
between old Greek system - Hatt and modern reference systems.

Some technical reference written in Greek can be found here__

Software library for geodetic transformations on earth
ellipsoidal surface.

C code compiles under Microsoft Visual C++ 6. I suppose
that it compiles under any C compiler with few
modifications on the code. A Makefile is included,
I have tested it on a Linux system with gcc.
